# Chiroid
Chiroid is a robot arm that I developed originally for a Science Olympiad competition. This development of this robot is 5 years and ongoing. 

* Iteration 1-3 (defunct): Developed 6 servo robot arm system for Science Olympiad (won 6th place out of 35 teams at LA Regionals)
* Iteration 4 (current stage): Developed a quality control robot arm with smoothing algorithm for arm movement
* Iteration 4.5 (inactive): Developed a cotton candy delivery robot arm with a simple two point input algorithm to move 4 servos into position
* Iteration 5 (in planning stage): 6 degrees of freedom robot arm that performs in three modes (controlled, two point input, autonomous) with detachable bits

The programs in this repository were used in some of the projects that I made.
